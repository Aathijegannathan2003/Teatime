            <!-- History Of tea -->
            <div class="historyoftea">
                <h1>A Brief History of Teas in India - TeaOrigin</h1>
                <p>1) Drinking tea in India has been evolving in many ways, with every region of this vast country making its own chai variants. The history of tea goes back almost 5,000 years. There are more than 3,000 different variations of tea available in the market. The most widely consumed beverage in the world has both a historical and cultural importance that cannot be rivaled.    </p>
                <p>2) The origin of tea started in China. This story goes back to ancient China, more than 5000 years ago. During the time, an Emperor by the name of Shen Nung was an herbalist. Once his servant unintentionally made an herbal mix when the leaves of a wild tree fell into the boiling water. The emperor was keen to know everything about that herbal mix as the pleasant aroma drew him to drink that mix. And that is how the tea was discovered. In China, for centuries, tea has been used as a lovely drink, herbal tonic, and various other medicinal uses.</p>
                <p>3) India is the world's one of the largest producer of tea. It was brought to India by the silk caravans that traveled from China to Europe centuries ago, though the Camellia Sinensis is also native to India, and grew in the wild long before its true worth was realized. Native Indians used the leaves as part of their diet sometimes, though mostly it was used for its medicinal properties.  </p>
                <p>4) In Assam, Nilgiri and Darjeeling, large parts of the jungle were cleared for tea production as the British established plantations to provide an alternative to expensive Chinese tea. It took a while for the Empire to develop a taste for the Assam tea they viewed as inferior, but tastes soon changed. Even in the United States (not a famed tea-drinking nation), by 1887 more Indian than Chinese tea was being consumed.  </p>

                <h1>Cultivation and harvesting  </h1>
                <p>1) Camellia sinensis is an evergreen plant that grows mainly in tropical and subtropical climates.[68] Some varieties can also tolerate marine climates and are cultivated as far north as Cornwall in England,[69] Perthshire in Scotland,[70] Washington in the United States,[71] and Vancouver Island in Canada.[72] In the Southern Hemisphere, tea is grown as far south as Hobart in Tasmania[73][74] and Waikato in New Zealand.[75]   </p>
                <p>2) Tea plants are propagated from seed and cuttings; about 4 to 12 years are needed for a plant to bear seed and about three years before a new plant is ready for harvesting.[68] In addition to a zone 8 climate or warmer, tea plants require at least 127 cm (50 in) of rainfall per year and prefer acidic soils.[76] Many high-quality tea plants are cultivated at elevations of up to 1,500 m (4,900 ft) above sea level. Though at these heights the plants grow more slowly, they acquire a better flavour.[77]                </p>
                <p>3) Pests that can afflict tea plants include mosquito bugs, genus Helopeltis, which are true bugs and not to be confused with dipterous insects of family Culicidae ('mosquitos'). Mosquito bugs can damage leaves both by sucking plant materials, and by the laying of eggs (oviposition) within the plant. Spraying with synthetic insecticides may be deemed appropriate.[83] Other pests are Lepidopteran leaf feeders and various tea diseases.       </p>
